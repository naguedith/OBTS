DISADVANTAGES OF EXISTING SYSTEM:
Although the earlier system facilitated bug tracking, it had several limitations that affected efficiency, accuracy, and overall project management.

Manual Effort and Time-Consuming Process: Since the existing system relied heavily on spreadsheets, emails, or basic documentation, tracking and updating bugs required significant manual effort. Developers, testers, and managers had to search, review, and update records manually, leading to delays in bug resolution.
Lack of Real-Time Updates: The absence of an automated system meant that updates on bug status were not available in real-time. Developers had to rely on periodic reports or direct communication, which could lead to delays in resolving critical issues.
Difficulty in Bug Assignment and Tracking: Without a centralized system, assigning bugs to the right developer and tracking their status was challenging. Managers and team leaders had to manually check records, leading to miscommunication or oversight in task assignments.
Limited Collaboration and Communication: Since the existing system relied on emails or basic ticketing systems, collaboration between developers, testers, and project managers was not seamless. Important updates, discussions, or dependencies were often lost in long email threads or unstructured documents.
Lack of Proper Historical Records and Audit Trails: Maintaining a structured history of bug reports, status updates, and developer actions was difficult. Tracking past bugs for future reference or analyzing patterns of recurring issues was not efficient, making it harder to improve software quality over time.
Risk of Data Loss and Inconsistencies: Manual documentation and spreadsheet-based tracking systems were prone to data loss, duplication, or inconsistency. Errors in bug descriptions, missing updates, or accidental deletion of records could impact the accuracy of bug tracking.
Difficulty in Prioritization and Critical Issue Management: Since bugs were manually documented, prioritizing them based on severity levels (High, Medium, and Low) was not always effective. Critical issues might go unnoticed or get delayed, impacting the software’s stability and performance.
Overall, the earlier system lacked automation, real-time tracking, and efficient collaboration, making bug management a time-consuming and error-prone process.





PROPOSED SYSTEM:
The Online Bug Tracking System is designed to provide an efficient and automated approach to managing software bugs. It streamlines the process of bug identification, assignment, tracking, and resolution by integrating a structured workflow for Managers, Team Leaders, and Developers. The system is developed using Java as the coding language, JSP, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend and MySQL for the database.
The system begins with a Developer Registration Module, where new developers can register by providing essential details such as Name, Email, Password, Domain (Java, .NET, or Android), Date of Birth, Phone Number, and Location. Once registered, the Manager logs in using a default username and password to review and activate the developers, assigning them to their respective domains.
After activation, the Team Leader logs in and gains access to multiple functionalities, including Affix New Bug, Analyze Bug Report, Bug Check, and Bug Status Tracking. The Affix New Bug feature allows the Team Leader to report a bug by entering details such as Bug Summary, Bug Description, Platform, Product, and Critical Level (High, Medium, or Low). Through the Analyze Bug Report module, the Team Leader can search for specific bugs using their summary. In the Bug Check feature, the Team Leader assigns the bug to the appropriate developer based on their expertise.
When a Developer logs into the system, they can view assigned bugs in the Triage Inbox section. The developer can update the bug’s status as Rectified, Not Rectified, or Working on it through the Update Option, which is then reflected in the Team Leader’s dashboard for review.
Additionally, the system maintains a Trace History of Bug module, where the Manager can monitor the entire bug resolution process, including details such as Bug ID, Date & Time, Developer Name, Assigned/Completed Status, and Bug Summary. This ensures that all activities are recorded for future reference and analysis.
The Online Bug Tracking System provides a structured and centralized approach to bug management, ensuring seamless coordination between developers, team leaders, and managers.






EXISTING SYSTEM:
In the existing system, bug tracking and management were typically handled through manual processes or basic documentation methods. Software development teams relied on spreadsheets, emails, or standalone databases to record and monitor bug reports. Developers, testers, and managers communicated through emails or direct messaging to report issues, assign tasks, and track progress.
In the existing system, Bug reports were generally maintained in text documents or spreadsheets, where details such as bug descriptions, severity levels, affected modules, and assigned developers were manually recorded. Developers would regularly check these records to identify issues assigned to them and update their status accordingly. Testing teams documented bug reports and forwarded them to project managers or team leads, who manually assigned them to appropriate developers for resolution.
In the existing system, to facilitate tracking, some organizations used basic ticketing systems where bugs were logged with an identifier, description, priority level, and status. Team leaders manually reviewed these tickets and updated them based on developer feedback. In some cases, development teams integrated basic bug-tracking functionality within project management tools to monitor progress.
The system ensured that bug reports were documented and assigned to developers for resolution, providing a structured approach to handling software defects. It enabled teams to maintain a record of identified bugs, monitor their resolution, and ensure proper communication among developers, testers, and project managers.
